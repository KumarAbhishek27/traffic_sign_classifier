To create our traffic sign classifier, we:

1).Utilized the popular German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) as our dataset.

2).Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network called TrafficSignNet using the Keras deep learning library.

3).Trained TrafficSignNet on the GTSRB dataset, obtaining 95% accuracy.

4).Created a Python script that loads our trained TrafficSignNet model and then classifies new input images.
